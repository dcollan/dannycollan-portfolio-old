        <div class="portfolio-item-individual">
            <p>In this project, I made a basic react application that is supposed to
            take information from customers who had interacted with different sorts of
            companies, and have displayed: their full name, email, phone number, city,
            state, country, the company the customer interacted with, the customer's 
            current job, and details regarding the customer's patronage to the company. 
            </p>
            <img src="img/Project-6.jpg" alt="">
            <p>There are two components to this application: the Customers component,
            where it will display a list of customers, and the Customer Details
            component, where it will display the details of a selected customer.
            Both of these functions work by obtaining data from a JSON file located
            in an assets folder. The Customer Details component is the child component
            of the Customers component.
            </p>
            <p>The sole purpose of this application was to become more familiar with
            react, and the tools it uses to develop big applications. When creating
            this small application, JSON, Node.js, HTML5, and CSS3 were all used during
            its development. I began working on this small project at first independently
            simply because I had a great interest to learn react. I had a lot of passion
            wanting to explore different technologies, and with react being one of them,
            I wanted to see if I could develop a nice application with it. Now that I have,
            I feel I have definitely become a lot more familiar using this unique technology.
