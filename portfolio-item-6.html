            <p>For this project, I began to work on a small science-related Java
            application for none other than a curiosity that arose when I was
            doing some research one day recently last year regarding how scientists
            make their advancements with modern-day technology. Learning that they look
            deep into particle research, I've discovered that what scientists love to do
            to uncover these amazing discoveries, where they always lead to reaching new
            milestones in various sectors, is collide particles (protons or electrons)
            against each other (in a related project, I've done a Python application
            that is based on the facility scientists use to conduct particle collision
            for their research).
            </p>

            <p>Regarding the project shown above, this is for a simple simulation using some
            intermediate Java that portrays the collisions various protons make as they are
            bouncing off one another in a fitted screen. In the simulation, as the frequency
            in collisions increases, the speed will increase as well. At a certain point, as
            the simulation continues, the screen will begin portraying colliding protons 
            significantly speeding past one another, at which exiting the application
            would now be highly recommended. Though this minor application seems to only
            display a graphical simulation of protons colliding against one other, I have
            found it to be quite an educational thing to develop and learn regarding the
            behavior of atoms, and even rather fun.
