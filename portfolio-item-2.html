            <p>This mobile application was done independently for a human-computer interaction
                course during the final semester of my time attending SFSU. Though this was simply a small, 
                "theoretical" mobile app that served very much like a UI design interface, I feel this still
                had some good use for my own experience and my overall knowledge regarding how mobile apps
                today are being developed: by first creating a UI interface, and then using this sketch to
                do some actual coding, knowing what the blueprints for the mobile application would look like.
                As a matter of fact, this project has helped me significantly with creating my second mobile
                application, Charm (displayed as my third piece of work).
            </p>
            <img src="img/Project-2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>When creating this mobile application, I used Java and XML to be able to compile
                everything together. The Java was used to give the capability for the user to be able to
                click on buttons and to go to a specific page after one was clicked, where the XML was
                used very much like CSS: to add the design, colors, font styles, and background to each
                page.
            </p>
            <p>As mentioned, though this mobile app was simply a theoretical "click-on-the-button-for-the-next-
                page" type of small project with no actual backend, its "purpose" once it was finished was to grant the 
                user a random task per day to do an outdoor activity. Once the user first enters the app, he/she will 
                select a specific outdoor category: to do something that relates to doing exercises, doing hobbies,
                doing meditative tasks outside, or to simply socialize. Once the user selects a category out of the four,
                he/she will assign themselves a number of days to do the routine. If the user, in any way, is 
                incapable of completing the given outdoor activity, he/she has the options to either be granted a
                new activity of that same category, or to choose a different category (this will cause for the user
                to lose all of his/her progress). The user is free to view their lifetime statistics since they have
                downloaded the app, or to simply exit the application.
