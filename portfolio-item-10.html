        <div class="portfolio-item-individual">
            <p>For this task, I've created an application using React that serves
            the educational purpose of allowing people to create their own GraphQL
            APIs, write GraphQL clients, and establish communication between
            both backend and frontend.
            </p>
            <p>There are two ways to run the application: to run the backend API,
            simply enter the command "cd GraphQL-Fun-Tutorial/backend" to navigate
            to the backend directory of the project, and then enter "yarn" to install
            all the necessary components of the API. Once everything has been installed,
            enter "yarn start" to start the server at localhost:5000.

            <img src="img/Backend.png" alt="">
            <p>While in the server (shown in the image above), the user is able to
            practice creating queries, mutations, and subscriptions by entering their
            code in the left-hand portion of the website. Note that once they 
            have created either, the information entered will be stored and can be
            displayed in the front end API of the application that uses Apollo. To
            be able to run and save the entered information on the left-hand side,
            simply click the play button located in the middle hovering between the
            two halves of the page. In the backend API, the user can view their
            current schemas and downloaded content by clicking on their tabs to the
            right of the screen, as well as their history and if they wish to improve
            the structure of their information provided through the "Prettify" button
            located just above the field to enter their code. 
            </p>

            <img src="img/Frontend.png" alt="">
            <p>
            If the user wishes to see their entered information (whether they are queries,
            mutations, or subscriptions) take action in a deployed front-end API where the
            user can interact with them, simply enter the command "cd GraphQL-Fun-Tutorial/frontend"
            to navigate to the front end directory of the project. Once this is done, enter "yarn"
            again for this part to install all the necessary components for developing the front end
            API needed to run, and then "yarn start" afterwards to start the server at localhost:5000.
            Note that this is all done using the Apollo client. Once the user is in the page, the user
            can, for instance, create a title for their query with a descriptive note added to it, and
            have their queries displayed carrying those specific titles and descriptions to the right
            of the page.             
             </p>
