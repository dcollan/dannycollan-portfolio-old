                    <h3>Front End</h3>
                    <p>I am proficient with full-stack. This can include working
                    with front-end segments that involve using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                    Bootstrap, React, jQuery, and Angular. For back-end segments, I am
                    most familiar with compiling codes using Django, Node.js, Python,
                    MongoDB, PHP, .NET, Java, and C++, where I am able to link SQL
                    databases using SQlite or MySQL. I have great passion to attend 
                    hackathons and tech conferences nearby my area as well. With team
                    collaboration, I work very efficiently when working with others as
                    a team. When it comes to working with certain technologies, I set
                    myself with a mentality that says, "With more work done sooner, the
                    less stress I will have to face in the future being preoccupied about
                    having the task finished." Thus, with the more work done, the more
                    experience I will be able to gain. Currently being without work
                    experience for the moment, it does continuously become a great
                    ambition of mine to keep building my level of expertise with
                    full-stack, both front-end and back-end.

                    <h3>Application Development</h3>
                    <p>The most experience I have had with application development
                    can include the kinds of work I did while attending San Francisco
                    State University. These can include creating a social website to
                    upload photos, creating a mobile app alike Instagram to share
                    new photos and have users interact with them, creating a simple
                    mobile application that serves as a UI interface, or developing a
                    college restaurant website to have customers search for nearby
                    restaurants within the campus's radius and place orders on their
                    page.

                    <h3>QA Testing</h3>
                    <p>When developing a restaurant website called Gator Grub
                    alongside a team of 5 other people during my time attending SFSU,
                    we conducted QA testing to assure that the application was
                    well-functional, and had not carried any bugs inside that would
                    negatively affect the user's experience. Since we were to present
                    our work for a local institution from Germany, creating a
                    collection of our work, adding documentation to it, and then
                    checking to see if it had met the requirement criteria for the
                    applicable standards of a proper running application without any
                    flaws prior to initiating its launch was deemed highly necessary.

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>My name is Danny Collan, and I am a recent graduate from San Francisco State University
                    with a major in Computer Science. My hobbies include creating new discoveries, traveling,
                    running, soccer, playing the guitar, and coding new exciting applications.
                </p>
                <p>My hometown is Fremont, CA, and every now and then, I like to do some research for my
                    passion in coding new applications. I do this to be able to gain some more insight on how
                    modern-day apps are currently being done in the world today. By learning from great
                    experienced coding professionals out there, it gives me outstanding potential to be
                    able to reach out, and become the best programmer I can be. 
                </p>
                <p>I like to attend virtual tech seminars (such as ones for Google Cloud or Adobe) and take
                    notes from certified representatives that come from all different sorts of companies.
                    Indeed, I believe with greater knowledge and making new discoveries, it is the proper 
                    way to lead yourself to making the best development possible.
