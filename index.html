                    <h3>My Passion</h3>
                     <p>I knew I wanted to get into design when I was a small youngster.
                     I would always play with LEGOs, and with my wildest imagination, I would
                     always make the biggest pieces, most creative pieces. Not only had I
                     enjoyed this very much as a hobby, but I also loved to draw art with
                     my computer. When I first got my smartphone during junior high, it was
                     the first time I had ever used mobile apps. I was extremely astonished
                     at first. How beautiful these apps were appearing on just the palm of
                     my hand! Facebook was the number one app I would always use, mainly
                     because it was social media, and still being just a young teenager who
                     greatly admired the aesthetics of a modern-day app built to connect
                     with your friends, I could not resist the beauty of using this new
                     technology for the first time. I knew I wanted to do something similar
                     in terms of creating similar social apps some day when I grow older.
                     With a continuous passion in digital design, I started to get into UI
                     development and UX design when I finished high school and began my years
                     in college. The very first application I had created was for a photo sharing
                     website called Social Catch. Done independently for a web development
                     course, I started this project out using a website called InVision, where
                     I outlined all the significant details that should be included in the
                     website, and of how all the photos should be arranged in an appealing 
                     manner. Within a few weeks, I eventually finished this website with a
                     wonderful UI following the design I made for its appealing UX. When I
                     became a part of more projects, I followed that same procedure: first
                     create a visual design outline of the application using a source such
                     as InVision, Figma, or Proto.io, and then proceeded on with the application
                     independently or with a team. At a certain point, I was just loving my role
                     with designing and then creating some of the most beautiful pieces of
                     software. Whenever I put myself in the shoes of a user, I always think
                     to myself, "Wow. I did that?" A truly happy and satisfying experience
                     to witness.

                    <h3>My Team Experience</h3>
                    <p>About a year after my graduation from college, I've begun freelance
                    work as a UX designer working remotely with a sports advertising company
                    called SportTechie. With a mission on linking its network to innovators and
                    power brokers who work to shape the future of sports technology through
                    storytelling and industry-leading events, I took on a role on assisting the
                    team's goal, along with its management, by providing a new wireframe designed
                    to attract more clients over to the company's website. Contributing to their
                    success for approximately three months, I would not only work with improving
                    the website's user experience, but I would also interact with developers and
                    management through Zoom meetings, where we would plan our schedules ahead of
                    time and make important decisions regarding how the web and mobile platforms
                    should appeal more to the clients. We knew that keeping our clients up to date
                    with the current news in sports technology maintaining the best UI possible
                    was the only way to keep profits up. In this case, the team had worked 
                    rigorously on this goal. When it was the end of my time freelancing for
                    SportTechie, the team had generously departed me with a sincere "Thank you for
                    the time and effort, and we wish you the best of luck with your career"
                    statement. Seeing this as a positive experience, I can say that this had
                    definitely been an outstanding and thrilling thing to have been a part of
                    that brought plenty of new ideas into my journey designing for UX.

                <div class="service">
                    <h3>QA Testing</h3>
                    <p>During my time in college, I took a software engineering course for
                    a class project working in a group of 6, where I took on the role as
                    frontend lead for my team. When my team and I were developing our website
                    for our project, we conducted QA testing to assure that our website was
                    well-functional, and did not hold any bugs that would negatively affect
                    the user's experience. Since we were to present our work for a local
                    institution from Germany, we created a collection of our work, added
                    documentation to it, and then checked to see if our application was meeting
                    the requirement criteria of having a properly executable application. If
                    there was anything wrong that we encountered, we would first leave the errors
                    there, stop where we were currently at, and then "freeze" the project. 
                    Freezing the project meant that we would first stop ourselves from jumping
                    into the next step, observe our work, and then record the information. As we
                    were doing this, we would write down everything we had from this point and
                    on, including all the errors we had from our current step. Doing so organized
                    the stages of our project into "milestones," where we knew it to be an
                    extremely convenient strategy that ensured the delivery of a top-notch,
                    well-executable application in the end.
