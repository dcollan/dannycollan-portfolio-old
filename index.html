                    <h3>My Passion</h3>
                     <p>Regarding my passion, this can be based on learning how to
                    experiment with and create new software applications using the
                    various types of frameworks and technologies we see today, including 
                    modern-day ones like Docker, Node.js, React, or Angular. With 4+
                    years of experience in coding, it remains my desire to continue 
                    to learn all new sorts of ideas that regard developing software,
                    as well as making room for self-improvement whenever applicable.
                    As a junior developer, I am always open to finding new approaches
                    in coding, as well as improving the way I write code during the
                    development or modification of an application.

                    <h3>My Team Experience</h3>
                    <p>About a year after my graduation from college, I've begun freelance
                    work as a web developer working remotely with a sports advertising company
                    called SportTechie. With a mission on linking its network to innovators and
                    power brokers who work to shape the future of sports technology through
                    storytelling and industry-leading events, I took on a role on assisting the
                    team's goal, along with its management, by enhancing the company's website,
                    desktop, and mobile platforms using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Contributing
                    to their success as a freelance web developer for approximately three months, I
                    would interact with software engineers and management through Zoom meetings,
                    where we would plan ahead our schedule, and assign tasks regarding how each
                    platform would appeal more to our clients. We knew that keeping our clients up
                    to date with the current news in sports technology using the best UI applicable
                    was the only way to keep our profits up, and so all software engineers and
                    developers (including myself) were constantly assigned tight deadlines to have
                    their tasks finished within 2-3 business days. At the end of my time there, I
                    was successfully able to assist with improving the technical aspects of the
                    company's software on both advertising and sponsorship campaigns, where I 
                    departed with a lot of industry experience in hand.

                    <h3>QA Testing</h3>
                    <p>During my time in college, I took a software engineering course for
                    a class project working in a group of 6, where I took on the role as
                    frontend lead for my team. When my team and I were developing our website
                    for our project, we conducted QA testing to assure that our website was
                    well-functional, and did not hold any bugs that would negatively affect
                    the user's experience. Since we were to present our work for a local
                    institution from Germany, we created a collection of our work, added
                    documentation to it, and then checked to see if our application was meeting
                    the requirement criteria of having a properly executable application. If
                    there was anything wrong that we encountered, we would first leave the errors
                    there, stop where we were currently at, and then "freeze" the project. 
                    Freezing the project meant that we would first stop ourselves from jumping
                    into the next step, observe our work, and then record the information. As we
                    were doing this, we would write down everything we had from this point and
                    on, including all the errors we had from our current step. Doing so organized
                    the stages of our project into "milestones," where we knew it to be an
                    extremely convenient strategy that ensured the delivery of a top-notch,
                    well-executable application in the end.
