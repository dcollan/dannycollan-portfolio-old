                    <h3>My Passion</h3>
                     <p>I'm very passionate when it comes to making new apps that
                    can bring people together. For instance, for one of my projects
                    called Charm, I had the desire for it to carry functionalities
                    just like Instagram. In the app, people would be able to follow
                    or unfollow each other, post photos from their phone's gallery,
                    comment, share, look up registered users in the app, and have
                    all of their photos displayed in their profile. Indeed, when
                    it came to coding new exciting applications that involved
                    posting new content for the connections people make on the app,
                    it's the thing I'd taken the most interest in. Modern social
                    media apps like Instagram have been most enjoyable to use, and
                    it keeps me motivated to code similar pieces of work using my
                    own creativity simply because it provides an enjoyable,
                    everlasting experience with a great understanding of software
                    development.

                    <h3>My Software Experience</h3>
                    <p>While attending college, I was part of a semester-long project
                    for a software engineering course where all students were divided
                    into groups of six, each consisting of the following roles: 
                    a team lead, a front-end lead, a front-end member, a back-end lead,
                    a back-end member, and a Github master. I chose to be the front-end
                    lead for my team. Here, the most experience I've gained from this
                    as front-end lead was guiding my front-end member through any trouble
                    she had. If she, for instance, encountered difficulties when she was
                    doing work assigned from me, I'd start a Zoom meeting with her,
                    and essentially teach her some front-end concepts that would help her
                    both resolve her issues and allow for her to use the knowledge 
                    for her own experience so that for the next time she encounters a
                    similar problem, she'd understand how to do it correctly that time.

                    <h3>QA Testing</h3>
                    <p>As my software team and I were developing our website for our
                    software engineering course during college, we conducted QA testing
                    to assure that our website was well-functional, and did not hold
                    any bugs that would negatively affect the user's experience. Since we
                    were to present our work for a local institution from Germany, we
                    created a collection of our work, added documentation to it, and then
                    checked to see if our application was meeting the requirements criteria
                    of a properly executable application. If there was anything wrong that
                    we encountered, for instance, we would first leave the errors there,
                    stop where we were currently at, and then "freeze" the project, meaning
                    that we would halt ourselves from jumping into the next step, observe and 
                    record our work, and then write down everything we had from that point
                    and on, including all the errors that we had at our current step.
                    Doing so had organized the stages of our project into "milestones,"
                    an extremely convenient strategy that had ensured the delivery of a
                    top-notch, well-executable application.
