                    <h3>My Passion</h3>
                     <p>I'm very passionate when it comes to working with software using
                    all sorts of the latest technologies that will increase my experience
                    handling them, and that will also deliver a good experience to the user,
                    ensuring that the information they provided is well-protected and secure.
                    Having them exit the application satisfied, knowing that they can return
                    back to it anytime without encountering any compromised data was the
                    most important thing to consider when doing these applications. After 
                    graduating from college, for instance, I put in a vast amount of time
                    developing new applications that were either science related, educational,
                    sociable, entertaining, and useful in ways that gives the user a fast, safe,
                    and thrilling experience in comparison to having to go to various websites
                    just to satisfy their needs and security (an example would be a single
                    restaurant-searching website that would allow users to quickly and safely
                    place orders from different restaurants that are all registered in that
                    website).

                    <h3>My Team Experience</h3>
                    <p>While attending college, I was part of a semester-long project
                    for a software engineering course where all students were divided
                    into groups of six, each consisting of the following roles: 
                    a team lead, a front-end lead, a front-end member, a back-end lead,
                    a back-end member, and a Github master. I chose to be the front-end
                    lead for my team. Here, the most experience I've gained from this
                    as front-end lead was guiding front-end through any trouble we had.
                    If members, for instance, encountered difficulties when work had been
                    assigned by me, I'd start a Zoom meeting with front end to collaborate,
                    where I'd teach some front-end concepts that would help us all
                    resolve the issues we had and allow for us to use the knowledge 
                    for good experience in the future so that for the next time if similar
                    issues were encountered, we'd understand how to do it correctly.
                    </p>

                    <h3>QA Testing</h3>
                    <p>As my software team and I were developing our website for our
                    software engineering course during college, we conducted QA testing
                    to assure that our website was well-functional, and did not hold
                    any bugs that would negatively affect the user's experience. Since we
                    were to present our work for a local institution from Germany, we
                    created a collection of our work, added documentation to it, and then
                    checked to see if our application was meeting the requirements criteria
                    of a properly executable application. If there was anything wrong that
                    we encountered, for instance, we would first leave the errors there,
                    stop where we were currently at, and then "freeze" the project, meaning
                    that we would halt ourselves from jumping into the next step, observe and 
                    record our work, and then write down everything we had from that point
                    and on, including all the errors that we had at our current step.
                    Doing so had organized the stages of our project into "milestones,"
                    an extremely convenient strategy that had ensured the delivery of a
                    top-notch, well-executable application.
