                    <h3>My Passion</h3>
                     <p>I knew I wanted to get into development as a youngster.
                     I would always play with LEGOs, and using my wildest imagination, I would
                     always make the biggest, most creative pieces. When I first got my smartphone
                     during junior high, it was the first time I had ever used mobile apps. I
                     was extremely astonished at first. How beautiful these apps had appeared on
                     just the palm of my hand! It was also the first time I'd frequently use Google
                     since I could go anywhere with my smartphone and look things up while on the road.
                     Facebook was also an app I'd always use to connect with my friends mainly
                     because it was social media, and still being just a teenager who had
                     just immersed himself in an new exciting world of modern-day technology, 
                     I could not resist the temptation to do something similar once I grew older.
                     When I first started to get into software when I finished high school and 
                     began my years attending college, I created my very first application.
                     Being a simple photo sharing website called Social Catch, I did this 
                     independently for a web development course. When I became a part of more
                     projects as I was attending college, I followed that same procedure: first 
                     create a wireframe to outline the project, write out its documentation
                     to record all the steps done, develop the application, and then finalize it
                     through QA testing either independently or with a team to make sure that
                     there are no flaws to the application. As I was completing more projects,
                     I found myself deeply immensed into software. For instance, whenever I put myself
                     in the shoes of a user, I would always think to myself, "Wow. I did this?"
                     An experience I always find to be truly satisfying and rewarding.

                    <h3>My Software Team Experience</h3>
                    <p>While attending college, I was part of a semester-long project for a software
                    engineering course where all students were divided into groups of six, each
                    consisting of the following roles: a team lead, a front-end lead, a front-end
                    member, a back-end lead, a back-end member, and a Github master. I chose to be
                    the front-end lead for my team. Here, I have gained a lot of experience as both
                    a leader and as a mentor for front-end and even for team lead. As front-end lead,
                    it was my duty to make sure front-end was doing its work, and to avoid falling
                    behind schedule, as this could result in a poorly developed application during
                    delivery. To make the best use of my time, I assisted a front-end member for any
                    trouble she had encountered. For instance, if she encountered difficulties
                    while she was doing any work assigned by me, I would discuss this with her in a
                    Zoom meeting, where we would essentially collaborate, and I would be teaching her
                    some front-end concepts that could help her both resolve her technical issues and
                    have her use the knowledge to solve similar problems in the future.

                    <h3>QA Testing</h3>
                    <p>During my time in college, I took a software engineering course for
                    a class project working in a group of 6, where I took on the role as
                    frontend lead for my team. When my team and I were developing our website
                    for our project, we conducted QA testing to assure that our website was
                    well-functional, and did not hold any bugs that would negatively affect
                    the user's experience. Since we were to present our work for a local
                    institution from Germany, we created a collection of our work, added
                    documentation to it, and then checked to see if our application was meeting
                    the requirement criteria of having a properly executable application. If
                    there was anything wrong that we encountered, we would first leave the errors
                    there, stop where we were currently at, and then "freeze" the project. 
                    Freezing the project meant that we would first stop ourselves from jumping
                    into the next step, observe our work, and then record the information. As we
                    were doing this, we would write down everything we had from this point and
                    on, including all the errors we had from our current step. Doing so organized
                    the stages of our project into "milestones," where we knew it to be an
                    extremely convenient strategy that ensured the delivery of a top-notch,
                    well-executable application in the end.
