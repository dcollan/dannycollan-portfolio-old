                    <h3>My Passion</h3>
                     <p>I knew I wanted to get into development as a youngster.
                     I would always play with LEGOs, and using my wildest imagination, I would
                     always make the biggest, most creative pieces. When I first got my smartphone
                     during junior high, it was the first time I had ever used mobile apps. I
                     was extremely astonished at first. How beautiful these apps had appeared on
                     just the palm of my hand! It was also the first time I'd frequently use Google
                     since I could go anywhere with my smartphone and look things up while on the road.
                     Facebook was also an app I'd always use to connect with my friends mainly
                     because it was social media, and still being just a teenager who had
                     just immersed himself in an new exciting world of modern-day technology, 
                     I could not resist the temptation to do something similar once I grew older.
                     When I first started to get into software when I finished high school and 
                     began my years attending college, I created my very first application.
                     Being a simple photo sharing website called Social Catch, I did this 
                     independently for a web development course. When I became a part of more
                     projects as I was attending college, I followed that same procedure: first 
                     create a wireframe to outline the project, write out its documentation
                     to record all the steps done, develop the application, and then finalize it
                     through QA testing either independently or with a team to make sure that
                     there are no flaws to the application. As I was completing more projects,
                     I found myself deeply immensed into software. For instance, whenever I put myself
                     in the shoes of a user, I would always think to myself, "Wow. I did this?"
                     An experience I always find to be truly satisfying and rewarding.

                    <h3>My Team Experience</h3>
                    <p>About a year after my graduation from college, I've begun freelance
                    work as a UX designer working remotely with a sports advertising company
                    called SportTechie. With a mission on linking its network to innovators and
                    power brokers who work to shape the future of sports technology through
                    storytelling and industry-leading events, I took on a role on assisting the
                    team's goal, along with its management, by providing a new wireframe designed
                    to attract more clients over to the company's website. Contributing to their
                    success for approximately three months, I would not only work with improving
                    the website's user experience, but I would also interact with developers and
                    management through Zoom meetings, where we would plan our schedules ahead of
                    time and make important decisions regarding how the web and mobile platforms
                    should appeal more to the clients. We knew that keeping our clients up to date
                    with the current news in sports technology maintaining the best UI possible
                    was the only way to keep profits up. In this case, the team had worked 
                    rigorously on this goal. When it was the end of my time freelancing for
                    SportTechie, the team had generously departed me with a sincere "Thank you for
                    the time and effort, and we wish you the best of luck with your career"
                    statement. Seeing this as a positive experience, I can say that this had
                    definitely been an outstanding and thrilling thing to have been a part of
                    that brought plenty of new ideas into my journey designing for UX.

                    <h3>QA Testing</h3>
                    <p>During my time in college, I took a software engineering course for
                    a class project working in a group of 6, where I took on the role as
                    frontend lead for my team. When my team and I were developing our website
                    for our project, we conducted QA testing to assure that our website was
                    well-functional, and did not hold any bugs that would negatively affect
                    the user's experience. Since we were to present our work for a local
                    institution from Germany, we created a collection of our work, added
                    documentation to it, and then checked to see if our application was meeting
                    the requirement criteria of having a properly executable application. If
                    there was anything wrong that we encountered, we would first leave the errors
                    there, stop where we were currently at, and then "freeze" the project. 
                    Freezing the project meant that we would first stop ourselves from jumping
                    into the next step, observe our work, and then record the information. As we
                    were doing this, we would write down everything we had from this point and
                    on, including all the errors we had from our current step. Doing so organized
                    the stages of our project into "milestones," where we knew it to be an
                    extremely convenient strategy that ensured the delivery of a top-notch,
                    well-executable application in the end.
