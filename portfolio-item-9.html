            <p>In this fun project, I've created a short space minigame in Ruby that
            is essentially just navigating your spaceship side-to-side, attempting to
            collect as many coins as possible for the purpose of competing against
            your friends, seeing who could reach the highest score before the player
            exhausts all three of their lives. The player can lose a life if he or
            she mistakenly stumbles upon a fiery object as the person is collecting
            coins. Once the player accumulates a certain amount of coins that fulfills
            the meter, the person will be advanced into the next level, where the speed
            of the falling coins (and fiery objects) will increase, making it more
            difficult for the player to avoid the fiery objects.
            </p>

            <p>Once the player has exhausted all three of their lives, the Game Over
            screen will display, prompting the player if he or she wishes to play
            again. The current player's highest score will be displayed at the top
            left corner of the screen as "Max score," in which whether or not the
            same player or another will begin another game, the max high score
            received prior will remain displayed until it has been surpassed, where
            the new high score received will replace the older one. 
            
            <p>While creating the game, this was done using RubyMine 2021. I've included
            a very appealing soundtrack that plays as the game is running, along with
            a UI that will immerse the player's focus into the game with a thrill of
            excitement.</p>
