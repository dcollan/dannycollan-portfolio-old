            <p>For this project, I have done this in a team of 6 for
                my last semester attending SFSU for a software engineering
                course. Our main task was to behave alike a real, legitimate
                company, where our instructor would act as the CEO, and his
                his partner (my previous instructor from my web development
                course), the CTO. Our team was divided up into roles:
                1 person would be the team lead, 1 person would be the front-end
                lead, 1 would be a front-end member, 1 would be a back-end lead, 1
                would be a back-end member, and the last would be the Github master
                (the one responsible for keeping our work organized on Github 
                and adding changes to the repositories if necessary). I was the
                front-end lead.
            </p>
            <img src="img/Project-4.png" alt="">
            <p>For our project, we have done a restaurant website called Gator Grub
                for our college. In this website, we decided to use Python, Flask,
                Bootstrap, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, with Linux being our
                platform to work on. As the front-end lead, I dealt the most with
                doing the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS of Gator Grub using Flask imports (with
                some assistance from my front-end member). Our backend dealt with creating
                our restaurant website server on AWS and doing the SQL queries while making
                updates to the Python code we all worked on together to link our front-end
                work to the queries. My team lead contributed by adding the Bootstrap template
                to our website, while our Github master assisted with any issues we had with
                pushing our work to the repositories on Github.
            </p>
            <p>To describe the purpose of this website, it was to allow for customers to be
                able to search for any restaurants nearby campus, and allowing for him/her to
                be able to make orders from their page through Gator Grub. We have enabled
                several functionalities for our website, such as adding Google Maps for the
                customer to locate the restaurant, adding an orders page that carries all of
                the customer's orders (including if he/she wishes to make any adjustments to
                an order), allowing the customer to be able to search for restaurants through
                a nav bar, and to be able to log in and out of their account.
            </p>
            <p>For this restaurant website, we have not just included functionality
                for the customer, but also for delivery people and new aspiring managers
                wishing to put their restaurants up on Gator Grub so that it would be 
                available to seeking customers looking for a restaurant in the website.
                For these kinds of things, we have included pages for delivery people to
                check up on any order they receive from customers if they chose for delivery
                so that they may transport the food from that specific restaruant to their
                location. We have also included pages for managers of restaurants to be able
                to update their restaurant's information, and if whether or not they wish to
                take it off from Gator Grub.
